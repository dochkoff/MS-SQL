# MS SQL

## Course Description

Databases are the standard way of utilizing dynamic information in modern technologies, making them an integral part of almost every application. The intensive course on database fundamentals will acquaint the students with one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. [The course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4182/ms-sql-september-2023) pays serious attention to the relational model, data modeling with ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships), and working with the SQL language (data retrieval, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion, and insertion). Fundamental knowledge is provided for working with ACID transactions and transaction processing, along with practical advice for optimizing performance. This course lays the foundations for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understand concepts such as transforming a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).
